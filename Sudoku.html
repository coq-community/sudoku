        <P>
        This page lets you solve your Sudoku. The position is entered
        by clicking on the different squares of the Sudoku. For example,
        5 is put on an empty square by clicking
        five times on it. Once the position is entered, click on
        the "Solve" button to solve it. If you want to start from
        scratch, click on the "Clear" button.
